						<p>Hi, My name is Jose Chavez. I have been a front end developer for a long time. I have been working on many projects of my own and professional as well.  My passion to solve the most complex problems in the world have taken me to get special skills in many front-end technology and back –end as well.
				 
						As a hobby I enjoy reading and watching tutorials to further advance my knowledge in these languages. As a junior developer, I am open and willing to work and learn more about anything that is given to me with no excuse. I am very interested in working on any type of project specially if it is challenging and complex.
						 
						I would like to be given the opportunity to be able to utilize and apply my skills, abilities and knowledge that can help and benefit you in a high degree. So enough of writing and let's change the world together. PS </p>

			         Viojar is a personal android video application that will make sharing videos easier between social medias. You are probably thinking there are already applications that do that already. Well, my algorithm will not only make sharing easy but it will make uploading and watching videos much faster by compressing the size of the video to its limit without loosing quality on the video.</p>

					<p> When Jerry the founder of Employtoy first approached me to join his team, I could have never imagined that the event would be a catalyst towards me becoming a Lead Front-end developer. Fast forward a few months later, there I was, taking a huge responsability of a website. Soon we will revolutionize the way companies look for employers and people find jobs.<br /><br />

					What initally began as an a internship, Employtoy will become my nest for growth and lerning.I had the opportunity to become a lead front-end developer of a startup company that is not only inpacting the world in a positive way, but is changing how people find jobs out there in an already saturated market.</p>

				   <p> For many years I have been fascinated on how machines and humans interact together in everyday life. Going back 3 years ago when I started my degree in Computer Science I tought that it will be nice to experience making codes that act like humans. You may be thinking this guy is crazy because we already have siri and goggle now which are petty smart already. They are good at what they do, but not good enough. At the beginning I tough that building something like google now will be impossible for me, but not to long ago I started to develop Mia, an artificial intelligence application with a real graphical face that will almost be like talking to another human.</p>
